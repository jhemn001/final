/**
This module computes the valid instructions organized in blocks of
code.  It infers the facts `code_in_block`, `block`, and `code`. In
addition it computes `block_still_overlap` for debugging purposes.

The disassembly is done in two traversals:

  - A "must" backward traversal that propagates invalid instructions
  - A "may" forward traversal that tries to generate a
    superset of all possible code blocks (with the predicates `possible_target`
    and `code_in_block_candidate`). This traversal has a recursive component
    and a linear-sweep component.

Finally, we detect candidate blocks of code that overlap with each other (and
therefore are in conflict) and give them points according to several
heuristics. Then for each two conflicting blocks we keep the one with
more points. For deciding code vs data, we consider code block
candidates and data block candidates.
